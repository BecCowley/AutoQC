Sensible lat/lon,Remove profile,Argo_impossible_location_test,Non controversial sanity check on location
Sensible date,Remove profile,Argo_impossible_date_test,Non controversial sanity check on date
Near surface XBT data,Remove above reject,CSIRO_depth,Standard reject of XBT data < 3.6 m
Wire break,Remove below reject,CSIRO_wire_break,Expert opinion is that this is highly reliable at detecting XBT wire breaks
Depth above surface,Remove rejected levels,ICDC_aqc_01_level_order,Flags depths less than zero (plus preprocessing for other ICDC checks)
